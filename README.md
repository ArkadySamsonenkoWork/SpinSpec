# Create a spin system with electron and nucleus
electron = particles.Electron(g_tensor=torch.tensor([[2.002, 0, 0], 
                                                     [0, 2.002, 0], 
                                                     [0, 0, 2.002]]))
nucleus = particles.Nucleus(spin=1))
system = spin_system.SpinSystem([electron, nucleus])
