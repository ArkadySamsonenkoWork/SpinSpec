    Base Time Dependent Populator. To compute the relaxation the following entities should be defined:
    1) Populator itself. Populator determines the population of initial states and how intensity is determined.
    2) Context is all data that are needed to compute relaxation
    3) Matrix_generator: It is an object that returns the probabilities of transitions depending on time:

            It uses automatic control of time-steps. If you are not sure about the correct time-steps use it
            - stationary_rate_solver. When A does not depend on time use it.
            It just uses that in this case n(t) = exp(At) @ n0
            - exponential_solver. When A does depend on time but does not depend on n,
            It is possible to precompute A and exp(A) in all points.
            In this case the solution is n_i+1 = exp(A_idt) @ ni
